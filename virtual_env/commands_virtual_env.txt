WITH REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE

Instead of using the environment file, you can also manually create the environment and subsequently install the necessary libraries.

To do so you at first have to create a conda environment:

conda create -n pytorchenv python=3.8.0

Then proceed with y -> Enter

conda activate pytorchenv

pip install -r requirements.txt
