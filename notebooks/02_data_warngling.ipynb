    "The **retina** is part internal of the nerve tissue of the eye that lines the back two-thirds of the organ. Its central region is in charge of the central vision and the outer layer is in charge of the peripheral vision. All these parts together as one, are responsible for receiving visual images, and it is the first step in decoding the signal. We can think of it as a sensor.\n",

    "**Retinopathy** term is used for diseases in general that are localized at the retina. There are several types of retinopathies and most of them affect the small retinal blood vessels and can be diagnosed by using a medical device called ophthalmoscope. \n",
    "\n",
    "These diseases can be caused for many reasons, including congenital, hypertension, or any other pathology that can affect small blood vessels. However, the most common type of retinopathy is the one caused by diabetic complications called (non-surprisingly) **Diabetic Retinopathy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As subclasses of the disease, we can find **proliferative** and **nonproliferative**. This term refers to the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, being the second one the most dangerous since it can impact the vision of the patient (including blindness in severe cases). Nonproliferative can also derive in proliferative, therefore, regular eye examinations and treatment (when necessary) are important for controlling this disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diabetes** has reached impressive numbers by 2017, [having almost 425 million people facing the disease and estimating almost 629 million by 2045](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-019-0566-0). According to this [article](https://www.asrs.org/patients/retinal-diseases/3/diabetic-retinopathy) from the [American Society of Retina Specialists](https://www.asrs.org/), half of the patients with diabetes and is the number one cause of irreversible blindness in working-age people, but there is substantial scientific evidence that early detection and timely treatment can prevent vision loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there have been programs based on the **analysis of fundus photographs** by specially trained ophthalmologists (mostly remote graders). However, although great eyes are behind the analysis, the diagnostic accuracy achieved may not be optimal, and scaling and [sustaining such programs has been found to be challenging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733521/). Additionally, the costs of those type of services could be quite high even for developed countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep learning**, a machine learning (ML) technique, [has shown promising diagnostic performance in several applications](https://chemport.cas.org/cgi-bin/sdcgi?APP=ftslink&action=reflink&origin=npg&version=1.0&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%2BC2MXht1WlurzP&md5=0114b2ed20ab1840e1c58bd5ab4170b8) such as in image recognition and computer vision tasks. These technologies have been widely adopted in many domains including healthcare and medicine. For medical imaging analysis in general, it has [achieved robust results in various medical specialities](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2017162326) such as radiology; for ophthalmology in particular, deep learning (DL) continues the tradition of [autonomous and assisted analysis of retinal photographs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-019-0566-0). Such **artificial intelligence (AI) systems** have been [demonstrated to lower cost, improve diagnostic accuracy, and increase patient access to Diabetic Retinopathy screening](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-019-0566-0). Recent works on DL in ophthalmology showcase its potential to at least partially replace human graders, while providing a similar level of accuracy. Nonetheless, being more adopted as a medical-aid systems than a replacement itself.\n"

    "As we can see in the introduction, Diabetes is a global eye health issue. Given the rising in diabetes prevalence, old population, retinopathy screening can pose a significant challenge even in developed countries. Int he past recent years, artificial intelligence using machine learning and deep learning have been adopted by the scientific community with the purpose of developing automated Diabetic Retinopathy detection algorithms. This project aims to implement one of these technologies using a Convolutional Neural Network using the above explained dataset and technical methodologies. Although many academics have published robust diagnostic performance of the AI algorithms for Diabetic Retinopathy screening, future research is required to address several challenges, for example and clinical deployment model to expedite the translation of these novel technologies into the healthcare setting (_text adapted from this [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41433-019-0566-0)_)."
